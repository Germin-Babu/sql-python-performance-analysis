## Dataset Overview

This project is based on a dataset comprising **six large, interrelated files** used to evaluate vendor performance, inventory movement, pricing, and profitability:

- `begin_inventory` – Opening inventory levels by product and vendor
- `end_inventory` – Closing inventory balances
- `sales` – Sales transactions and revenue details
- `purchases` – Purchase transactions and quantities
- `purchase_prices` – Unit cost and pricing information
- `vendor_invoice` – Vendor billing and invoice-level details

These files collectively support analysis across inventory turnover, gross profit, profit margins, purchasing behavior, and vendor contribution.

The datasets are **not included in this repository**, as the original files are large in size.

The focus of this repository is on:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical analysis and correlation insights
- Vendor performance evaluation
- Business-driven recommendations based on analytical findings

All visualizations, statistical results, and conclusions are documented in the `eda/` and `reports/` directories.
